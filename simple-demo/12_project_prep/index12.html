        <p> I had a lot of unexpected trouble getting the huzzah to read the thermocouple output. The output is only 1.2-1.5 millivolts at room temperature.
        I tried several amp options including: building an amp with a transistor; using an LM386 amp chip; and finally resorted to using a pre-amp that I 
        had from a control system I use to work on frequently. The problem with the pre-amp is that it requires a 24vdc input voltage. Therefore, I had to 
        incorporate the "complete" control mother board to get the correct voltage to the pre-amp. Photo below is the pre-amp.</p>

        <p>An Amp I have that takes a thermocouple input and outputs 1 millivolt per degree F of temperature:(this did not give a high enough output at room 
          temperature to break the 100 millivolt threshold required for the huzzah to work correctly using pin A2 to read an analog input voltage)
