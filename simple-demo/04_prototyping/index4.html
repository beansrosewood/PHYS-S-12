        <p> I decided to make a DC motor from bits of threaded rod, nuts, plywood, washers, copper drip-edge, and some  18/3 thermostat wire. </p>

        <p> (I hope to add more documentation to this posting later today!) </p>
        <p> I'm shockingly happy with how this "kinetic sculpture?" turned out? I really didn't have much of a plan in mind when I started on it Sunday morning, but 
          got lucky! Initially I intended to use large nails for the armature, stator, etc.. The biggest nails I had were 16D (3.5") so I went on to plan B (threaded 
          rod). Thank God I couldn't find the big nails!! That would have been a mistake. </p>
        <br>
        <p> I did not know how many turns of wire would be necessary to create adequate magnetic fields around the armature and stator, but felt that I needed as
          much resistance as I could get to keep the current in the curcit as low as possible. I used all the 18 gauge wire that was available in my garge--23 feet 
          of 18/3 thermostat wire. I love the simplicity of the circuit. The commutator/brushes basically act as a switch pulsing current through the two coils. I guess 
          this is some what similar to "pulse width modulation". The current is turned on twice per revolution of the armature. I tried to get a reading on the amp 
          draw, but the circuit pulses so quickly the multimeter did not register a consistant value. However, after running the motor sculpture several times the 10 
          amp fuse in the multimeter did blow. I think it happened on startup. The total resistance of the 69 feet of #18 wire that makes up the coils is one ohm. 
          I used a car battery to power the circuit (12.6vdc actual under load). V=I*R, I=V/R, 12.6vdc/1.0 ohms= 12.6 amps! Judging by the lack of power the motor seems to 
          have, most of the energy consumed must be heating up the coils and threaded rod. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The timing of the contact points on the armature could be set a little better: the circit turns on 45 degrees before the magnetic fields are lined up with 
          each other. However, the circuit stays on until about 45 degrees after alignment of the fields. I assume higher efficency would be realized if the curcuit 
          shut off at or maybe just before alignment of the magnetic poles. If time allows, I will adjust this timing. It will require removing the small copper pads on 
          commutator, and trimming their width to about 50% of the current size. <p/>
        <br>
        <p> Another detail of this super simple design is the fact that the polarity of the magnetic field around the armature is reversed with every other "pulse" of 
          current. This is simply accomplished by the rotation of the contacts of the commutator from the positive brush to the negative brush.
