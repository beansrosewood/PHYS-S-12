  <div class="row">
    
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p> For the programming aspect of my hotdog cooker project, the Arduino will have to control the following: </p>
        <br>
          <ul>
            <li>The program will need to close and open the safety cover of the hotdog cooking chamber;</li>
            <li>The solid state relay that switches the 120vac to the cooking electrodes will have to be turned on and off to very the power delivered to the 
              hotdog;</li>
            <li>A timer or counter will be needed to start and end the cooking process;</li>
            <li>Possibly a visible/audible signal during the time the hotdog electrodes are powered might be interesting and useful;</li>
            <li>Finally, a hotdog odometer to track the total number of hotdogs cooked would be interesting.</li>
         </ul>
        <br>
        
        <p>Here is the beta version block programming for the hotdog cooker:  (I do see a few mistakes that need to be corrected. I will put the rev 2 code in 
           tab for new class.)</p>

        <p> Arduino circuit: to control a servo motor that will close the cooking chamber. This will turn a lenght of 3/8-16 threaded rod that will act 
          as a linear actuator. After the cover is closed the solid state relay is pulsed to control the 120vac to the cooker nails. Two switches control
          four possible cooking intensities. Then the sevro motor opens the chamber and a tone is sounded.</p>

        <p> The object I desiged using fusion 360 is the beginnings of an audio horn that could possibly be used to amplify the sound from an iPhone. I would 
          like to curve the horn into a modified "S" shape. </p>
