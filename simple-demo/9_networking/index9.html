        <p>Since the last Fab Lab Zoom, I rigged up the hotdog cooker so that it can be activated over the web thru the esp32 Huzzah board. The Arduino Metro 
          controls the stepper motor which closes and opens the safety cover. This is not the program or wiring I intend to use for the final version, but is 
          just a beta test version to get the thing going with web control.
        <p> (Please get this one for me, Pikachu!) </p>

        <p> I do not know how to program these functions yet, but these are the things I would like the hotdog cooker to do with regard to it's connection 
        to the internet/web:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start hotdog cycle </li>
            <li>Select one of four "duty cycles" for hotdog (warmish, warm, hot, ouch!) </li>
            <li>Send a message when the weenie is ready! </li>
            <li>Increment the "hotdog odometer" by one when the weener is history!</li>
        </ul>
