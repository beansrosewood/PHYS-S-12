        <p> Here is a circuit I built during lab time to have a high and low beam LED. </p>
        <br>
        <p> This circuit changes the brightness of the LED by having two possible voltages across the LED terminals. The voltage is changed by
          closing the pushbutton switch. This created a second parallel resistor in the circuit which lowers the total resistance to ground for the LED, 
          causing the voltage across the LED to increase from 1.9vdc on low beam to 2.1vdc on high beam. The low resistor(which is always in the circuit 
          is a 1k ohms. The resistor that is engaged by the switch for high beam operation is 470 ohms. <p/>
