        <p> This circuit changes the brightness of the LED by having two possible voltages across the LED terminals. The voltage is changed by
          closing the pushbutton switch. This created a second parallel resistor in the circuit which lowers the total resistance to ground for the LED, 
          causing the voltage across the LED to increase from 1.9vdc on low beam to 2.1vdc on high beam. The low resistor(which is always in the circuit 
          is a 1k ohms. The resistor that is engaged by the switch for high beam operation is 470 ohms. <p/>

        <p> The video is of a circuit built with a potentiometer and a multi-color LED that is in our kit. The LED's color fades from blue to purple to red as 
             the potentiometer varies the voltage to the LED; as the voltage is decreasing on the "red" input pin it is simultaniously increasing on the "blue" 
             input pin.</p>
