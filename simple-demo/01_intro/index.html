        <p> Here I am with my wife, Sally: </p> 
   
        <img src="IMG_1880 (1).jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Sally & Steve">
        <p>    We live in Nashua, New Hampshire which is about 40 miles from room #102 at the Science Center. I'm 58 years old, and started taking classes
          at the Extension School 5 years ago. I am an accepted student at Harvard Extension School, and hope to receive an ALB degree on May 27,2021!
          My pursuit of a college education began in 1980, the year I graduated from Nashua High School. I majored in chemistry at Saint Anselm College,
          and transfered to Northeastern University after two years. </p>
        <p>   Then life, and a severe lack of money happened! I opened a small home renovation business so that I could eat, and started a family. All great things, 
          but not completing a college degree left a void, and an itch that needed to be scratched. My business evolved over the last 35 years into an industrial 
          equipment service operation. I mainly troubleshoot production line equipment at manurfacturing facilities around New Endland (I'm basically a "master 
          of the obvious" as my wife would say). </p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p> This is my son, Joe: </p> 
        
        <img src="IMG_3862.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:100%" alt="Joe"><br><br>
        <p>After our son Joe's college graduation in 2015 I desided to follow the wise words found in a fortune cookie given to me by my wife. The scrap of paper 
          inside said: "It's never too late to be the person you might have been."  </p>
        <br>
        <p>This summer, I had initially planned on taking a class to fulfill a moral reasoning requirement for graduation. However!, when I came across Digital Fab 
           in the course catalog, I quickly changed plans!! </p>
