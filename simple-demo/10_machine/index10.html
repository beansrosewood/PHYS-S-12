        <h3> Ketchup and Mustard Machine Gun! </h3>
        <br>
        <p> The "machine" project I have created adds ketchup or mustard to the hotdog after cooking. It uses a pair of pneumatic solinoid valves to dispense 
          the condiments from a couple of syringe-like cylinders that are actually made to apply glue. Compressed CO2 is used to pressureize the system. The
          solenoid valves I found on Amazon have 12vdc coils (first parts I had to buy for the hotdog cooker!!). I'm using two FET's with a car battery to get 12 
          vdc to the valves when ketchup or mustard are ordered. Also, the cover stepper is running at 60 rpm; the squirter stepper is running at 80 rpm. Both are
          running at the maximum that does not cause the steppers to skip/jump. I tryed to run the H-bridges with 12vdc, but they do not run well at all at that
          voltage. </p>

        <p> (Actual ketchup and mustard are not connected yet.) </p>
        <p> This is playing at 10 times actual speed. Notice the red LED which is lite when ketchup is being squirted and the yellow LED when the mustard gun is 
          firing. </p>
