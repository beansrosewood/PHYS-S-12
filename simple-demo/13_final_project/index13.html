        <p> For my final project this summer in Digital Fabrication I have choosen to re-engineer the 1950's "two-nails on a cord" hotdog cooker. I wish there 
        was a higher purpose to my selection of this project focus, but there really is not; the hotdog cooker does not need or want to be re-engineered. However, 
        The cooker is a good platform to incorporate many of the concepts learned in Digital Fabrication this summer.  </p>

        <p> This page is a photographic record of the progress of the two-nails cooker project as it has progessed over the last 7 weeks. I have been down many rabbit 
          holes along the way. This project has come a long way, yet still has a ways to go.
