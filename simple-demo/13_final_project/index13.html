  <h3> Final Project </h3> <br>
  <h3> Two nails with a whole lot of potential! </h3>

        <p> For my final project this summer in Digital Fabrication I have choosen to re-engineer the 1950's "two-nails on a cord" hotdog cooker. I wish there 
        was a higher purpose to my selection of this project focus, but there really is not; the hotdog cooker does not need or want to be re-engineered. However, 
        The cooker is a good platform to incorporate many of the concepts learned in Digital Fabrication this summer. Overall, I spent too much time building my 
        project, and not enough time on documentation. I really ran out of time in the last few days. I wish I had more time to work on the web app so that it could 
        control more of the hotdog cooker. All it can do is turn the cooker "on", and it displays the current hotdog temperature. I had intended to be able to 
        select the desired condiments and cooking cycle, but out of time.</p>

        <p> This page is a photographic record of the progress of the two-nails cooker project as it has progessed over the last 7 weeks. I have been down many rabbit 
          holes along the way. This project has come a long way, yet still has a ways to go.

        <p> A hotdog is about 1kohms, and there is about 3-5vac across the leds stuck in the dog seen below:</p>
